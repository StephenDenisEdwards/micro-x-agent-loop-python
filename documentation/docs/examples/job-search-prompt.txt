JOB SEARCH PROMPT - STEPHEN EDWARDS
====================================

MAIN PROMPT:
------------
Using the search criteria from 'job-search-criteria.txt', search my Gmail for all JobServe emails received in the last 24 hours. Read the full content of each email. Then search LinkedIn for similar UK contract roles matching my core skills and preferences, and get the full details of promising jobs.

Score each job against my search criteria using the FULL job content (1-10) based on:
- Technology match (core skills: .NET Core, Azure, AI/ML, Blazor, Python, Microservices)
- Seniority level match (Senior/Lead/Architect roles)
- Rate/salary match (£500-£700+/day preferred)
- Sector match (Healthcare, Finance, Legal, Industrial preferred)
- Location match (London or Remote UK)
- IR35 status (Outside IR35 bonus points)
- Special interests (AI/ML, Healthcare domain, FHIR/HL7, Regulatory)

Exclude roles scoring below 5/10.

Create a markdown file called 'todays-jobs-YYYY-MM-DD.md' (replacing YYYY-MM-DD with today's date, e.g. todays-jobs-2026-02-16.md). Do NOT add version numbers or suffixes — use exactly this naming format.

IMPORTANT - FILE WRITING:
When creating the output file, write it in stages. Use write_file for the first section (Top 10), then use append_file for the JobServe section, then append_file again for the LinkedIn section, then append_file for the Summary Statistics section. Do not attempt to write the entire file in one call.


REPORT FORMAT:
--------------
Follow this exact format. See 'todays-jobs-2026-02-16-v1.md' as the reference example.

### Title
```
# Today's Job Opportunities - [Month Day, Year]
```

### Section 1: Top 10 Best Matches

A numbered list ranked by score (highest first). Each entry on TWO lines:
- Line 1: Bold linked title with anchor to the detailed section, score
- Line 2: Indented one-line summary (rate, location, duration, key tech matches, notable constraints)

Use HTML anchor tags `<a id="anchor-name"></a>` before each detailed job heading below so the links work reliably.

Example:
```
1. **[Job Title](#anchor-name)** - Score: 8/10
   6 months, £500-650/day, Remote UK. Key tech matches. Notable constraint or highlight.
```

Followed by `---` separator.

### Section 2: JobServe Jobs (24 Hours)

For each job, use this exact structure:

```
<a id="anchor-name"></a>

### [Job Title]
**Score: X/10**

**Location:** [location and working pattern]
**Rate:** [rate/day or equivalent]
**Duration:** [contract length]
**IR35:** [status or "Not specified"]
**Posted:** [agency name], Ref: [reference]

**Summary:**
[One paragraph summarising the role, key technologies, responsibilities, and requirements. NOT the full job spec — a concise summary.]

```

### Section 3: LinkedIn Jobs (24 Hours)

Same structure as JobServe but with these fields instead:

```
<a id="anchor-name"></a>

**Score: X/10**

**Company:** [company name]
**Location:** [location]
**Type:** [Permanent/Contract] - [working pattern]
**Sector:** [sector]
**Posted:** [time ago]

**Summary:**
